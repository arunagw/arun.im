“Product owners have had few places to turn to for advice, despite having the hardest role on an agile project. This book rectifies that. Roman Pichler’s insights into the duties of the product owner are powerful and practical. Correctly applied, his advice will benefit any product owner and agile team.”

—Mike Cohn, Author of <a name="Estimating and"></a>Succeeding with Agile, Agile Estimating and Planning, and User Stories Applied

“Scrum is silent on how a product owner can maximize value. Most product managers and marketers don’t know how to use the iterative, incremental nature of Scrum to do so. Roman has filled this hole nicely with his new book, Agile Product Management with Scrum.”

—Ken Schwaber, codeveloper of the Scrum process

<a name="agile methods"></a>“With so little written on the intersections of agile methods and product management, Roman makes a significant contribution to the field. The book provides clear guidance and rich examples on how to become an agile product manager and a successful product owner, and, further, how to lead with a strong vision. This book is a must read for product managers new to Scrum, product owners new to product management, and any product manager who wants to get the most out of Agile.”

<a name="what Roman"></a>“I’m always happy to hear what Roman is thinking. What I really like about this book is that he not only shares his experience (“Common Mistakes” is a great section), but he also brings in the wisdom of others in the field. This powerful combination allows him to see farther ahead and share that vision with us. Thanks, Roman!”

—Linda Rising, Independent Consultant and coauthor of Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas
