<div class="entry">

  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>I have started using MongoDB for my projects.</p>

  <p>MongoDB is a powerful, flexible, and scalable data store. It combines the ability to scale out with many of the
    most useful features of relational databases, such as secondary indexes, range queries, and sorting. MongoDB has
    built-in support for MapReduce-style aggregation and geospatial indexes</p>
