  <p>Finally, I got the time to write something about my
    <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/arun-agrawal/commits" target="_blank">Rails
      Contributions</a>. I have started contributing in April 2011. In start i usually do some test cases fixes and some
    updates.</p>

  <p>After sometime i found that if you are using JRuby as a platform then you need to customize your template after
    generation. Or you need to use some custom template with -m option to customize your application.</p>

  <p>I started digging into the Rails code base and i found that it can be added easily. Then… I just added and my
    <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/300" target="_blank">pull request</a> got accepted. wOOOttt!!</p>

  <p>But that for master that means the feature will come in Rails 3.1 so after that i done some commits into 3-0-stable
    branch and yeah.. that feature is coming in Rails 3.0.10.</p>

  <p>It’s really great to talking those guys on github. Specially when they ask you to change something which you have
    written wrong.</p>

  <p>After that i started contributing in Rails more and more. It helps me to understand internal code and the basics of
    Ruby.</p>

  <p>In recent we organized two bugmashs and we were the part of global
    <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/7/14/rails-3-1-hackfest" target="_blank">Rails Hackfest</a>. It was
    really very good. Enjoyed. Learnt a lot.</p>

  <p>I am a part of <a href="http://bangaloreruby.org" target="_blank">BangaloreRubyUserGroup</a>&nbsp;which helps a
    lot.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Cheers,</p>
