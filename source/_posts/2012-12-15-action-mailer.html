Action Mailer is a framework in Rails which provides facility to write email using template and provides feature to send out emails for your app.

A simple example for Action Mailer is when you do signup you get an email from app that you successfullyÂ signed up!

Action Mailer uses  <a href="https://github.com/mikel/mail/"/>mail</a> gem.

Action Mailer is in essence a wrapper around Action Controller and the Mail gem. It provides a way to make emails using templates in the same way that Action Controller renders views using templates.

Action Mailer class can also be used to process incoming emails such as a support email which accept tickets using emails. We will talk about this later in this blog post.
