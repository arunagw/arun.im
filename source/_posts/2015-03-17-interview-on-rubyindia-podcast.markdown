Recently I had an interview on [RubyIndia Podcast](http://podcast.rubyindia.org/rubyindia/10) and we talked about my early experiences with Ruby, starting my contributions to [Open Source Projects](https://github.com/arunagw/) and currently [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), work and culture at [thoughtbot](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/).
