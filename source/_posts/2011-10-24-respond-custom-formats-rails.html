We usually respond some of the known formats in Rails Application like HTML, XML, JavaScript, RSS and some custom.

Have you tried to use your own custom format for your Rails Application?

Yes you can use your custom format in Rails Application.

Here showing a simple Rails Application with responding custom formats.

Get a new app
<pre>rails new music_library </pre>

Get a scaffold into App

<pre>rails generate scaffold mp3 title:string url:string description:text </pre>

Ok so you are ready to serve some music on your app with some formats!

Now you have to register MIME types in the Rails Application.

For that open up <code>Rails.root/config/initializers/mime_types.rb</code>

<pre>
Mime::Type.register 'audio/mpeg' , :mp3
</pre>

<strong>Now you can serve <code>.mp3</code> and content</strong>

For that your respond block should look like
<pre>
def show
  @mp3 = Mp3.find(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.mp3 { redirect_to @mp3.url }
  end
end
</pre>

Now if you call this action with <code>.mp3</code>
<pre>http://localhost:3000/mp3s/1.mp3</pre>

You will redirect_to <code>@mp3</code> url.
    
    Happy adding custom formats!!
