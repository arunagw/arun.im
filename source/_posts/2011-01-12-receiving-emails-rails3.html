To receive email you have to write a method which needs to public in any subclass of <code>ActionMailer::Base</code>. The name should be <code> receive.</code>

The method <code> receive.</code> will take a argument which is a <code>Mail::Message</code> obejct.

An example here :
<pre>class EmailReceiver  &lt; ActionMailer::Base

  def receive(email)
    person = Profile.find_by_email(email.to.first)
    person.emails.create(
      :subject =&gt; email.subject,
      :body =&gt; email.body
    )
  end
end</pre>
You can invoke this method on Mailer class to handle incoming email.

You don’t have to implement the <code>receive</code> class method yourself, it is inherited from <code>ActionMailer::Base</code>.
