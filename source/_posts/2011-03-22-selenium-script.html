Hey All,

I came with a situation where i need to test things from browser. It nothing to do with the different browsers. It just to check some validations, some messages with some existing data with me.

I can't touch the code base. It's something like QA work.

I am not very much aware about using of selenium IDE which is available in browsers.

I look into the selenium world with ruby and found some interesting stuff that i can script my test and run for a browser.

To run into the browser i need to setup selenium-rc server running.

I have done it in my way. Just small code and using selenium-client gem which allows me to start and stop the selenium-rc server.

Here is my code for selenium-rc server. It also includes the selenium-jar file.

For running selenium-rc server. Just clone it. bundle install and then rake selenium:rc:start

All set. Now you are ready to run selenium script from your local machine.

To test things i am using hitting up google.com and validating stuff. A google example is also given on the selenium-client gems readme.

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
#
# Sample Ruby script using the Selenium client API
#
require "rubygems"
gem "selenium-client", ">=1.2.16"
require "selenium/client"

begin
  @browser = Selenium::Client::Driver.new \
      :host => "localhost", 
      :port => 4444, 
      :browser => "*firefox", 
      :url => "http://www.google.com", 
      :timeout_in_second => 60

  @browser.start_new_browser_session
    @browser.open "/"
    @browser.type "q", "Selenium seleniumhq.org"
    @browser.click "btnG", :wait_for => :page
    puts @browser.text?("seleniumhq.org")
ensure
  @browser.close_current_browser_session    
end
</pre>

You can just run above script after start the selenium-rc server and see the result yourself in the browser.
