Hi Folks,

If you are doing any application in which you required JRuby as a platform. You can use Rails3.1 with that. activerecord-jdbc-adapter 1.2.0 is ok with that!

All the steps are same as for the normal Rails Application

You can find more details hereÂ <a href="http://blog.jruby.org/2011/09/ar-jdbc-1-2-0-released/">http://blog.jruby.org/2011/09/ar-jdbc-1-2-0-released/</a>

Cheers,
Arun
