I started posting blogs using self hosted <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> solution. After few years I realize that I should use Ruby/Rack framework. And drop this old way of doing blog post.

I tried moving away from Wordpress few times and one day got success. Finally I converted my all blog posts into markdown format.

Now it's very easy to choose a Ruby/Rack based framework as posts are already in markdown.

After that I bought a theme from bootstrap and applied that, but I was still using my hosted solution with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">middleman</a> generated site.

I survived with this for a long time. Problem was for every blog post I have to deploy site using git pull every time by logging into server.

At last I found octopress and a Heroku combination.

And here is my blog! Using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Heroku</a> and I love it. Simple and easy!
